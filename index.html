          React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by **Facebook** in 2011.
          It follows the component based approach which helps in building reusable UI components.
          It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI.
        </section>
        <section>
          Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of the largest communities supporting it.

        ### React Advantages
        * Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual
        DOM is faster than the regular DOM.
        * Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks.
        * Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps.
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ### Limitations of React
        * React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.
        * It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.
        * Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.
      </section>
      <section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Virtual DOM
          In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a
          representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn
          onscreen.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          In summary, here’s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:
          * The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
          * The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects
          have changed.
          * The changed objects get updated on the real DOM.
          * Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.

          ### Rendering with JSX
          JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language which provides a way to structure component rendering using
          syntax similar to HTML. JSX gives us the ability to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in the
          DOM by converting the HTML tags into React elements without the need for other methods like createElement() or
          appendChild().

          <pre><code data-line-numbers>
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
            </code></pre>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>

          ### Components
          Components are the building blocks of any React app. They are like JavaScript functions that accept arbitrary
          input (Props) and return React elements describing what should be displayed on the screen.
        </section>
        <section>
          The most direct way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function.
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
  function Badge(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, my name is {props.name}</h1>;
  }
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single prop (which stands for properties) object
          argument with data and returns a React element. Such components are called "function components" because they
          are literally JavaScript functions.
        </section>
        <section>
          Aside from function components, another type of component are "class components." A class component is
          different from a function component in that it is defined by an ES6 class, as shown below:
          <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
            class Badge extends React.Component {
              render() {
                return <h1>Hello, my name is {this.props.name}</h1>;
              }
            }
            </code></pre>
        </section>
      </section>

          ## Props
          Props are a short form for properties, and they simply refer to the internal data of a component in React.
          They are written inside component calls and are passed into components.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Two things that are worth remembering about props:
          * the value of a prop determined and used as part of the blueprint before the component is built.
          * the value of a prop will never change, i.e. props are read-only once they are passed into components.
        </section>
      </section>

        <section data-markdown>
          ## State
          State is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ### Components in React can be stateful or stateless.
          * A stateful component declares and manages local state in it.
          * A stateless component is a pure function that doesn't have a local state and side-effects to manage.
        </section>

        ## Keys
        In React, Keys are useful when working with dynamically created components. Setting the key value will keep your component uniquely identified after the change.
        They help React in identifying the items which have changed, are removed, or added.
      </section>
      <section data-markdown>
        ## React component’s lifecycle
        There are three different phases of React component’s lifecycle:
        1. Initial Rendering Phase
        2. Updating Phase
        3. Unmounting Phase.

          ## Hooks
          Before React version 16.8, developers could handle state and other React features only using class components. But with version 16.8, React introduced a new pattern called Hooks.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Advantages of using React Hooks
          1. Hooks in general enable the extraction and reuse of stateful logic that is common across multiple components. 
          2. Hooks allow to easily manipulate the state of our functional component.
          3. By using them, we can totally avoid using lifecycle methods.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## Five Important Rules for Hooks
          1. Never call Hooks from inside a loop, condition or nested function
          2. Hooks should sit at the top-level of your component
          3. Only call Hooks from React functional components
          4. Never call a Hook from a regular function
          5. Hooks can call other Hooks
